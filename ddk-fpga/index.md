## Introduction

This repository contains the HDL and constraint files necesseray for building the FPGA bitstream.
This repository also contains the testbenches and macro files used for simulation and verification of the behavioral model.
The DDK currently utilizes a Microsemi ProASIC3 Nano 125 [A3PN125][datasheet] FPGA.


## Hardware Design

The hardware is designed to provide as much flexibility as possible to custom applications.
The ARM and the FPGA share the following connections:

The ARM column is the pin name for the LPC ARM microcontroller.
Signal is the signal name in the CAD [schematic and board files](https://github.com/ddk/ddk-hardware) as well as in the [top module][top].
Finally, usage is what the pin is used for in the current DDK architecure.

## Architecural Design
The [top module][top] provides a wrapper around all of the vendor specific I/O and the CAD signal names.
Internally the [core achitecture][core] implements the open-source [Wishbone](http://cdn.opencores.org/downloads/wbspec_b4.pdf) interconnect to interface modules.
The parallel data bus ```DATA``` as well as the ```DataClk``` and ```DataWe``` signals are converted to signals conforming to the Wishbone interconnect in the [krake_bus](https://github.com/ddk/ddk-fpga/blob/master/hdl/krake_bus.v) module.

To generate the necessary strobe signals for individual modules, addresses defined in the [reg_defs](https://github.com/ddk/ddk-fpga/blob/master/hdl/reg_defs.v) are matched in the [ddk_core](https://github.com/ddk/ddk-fpga/blob/master/hdl/ddk_core.v#L337).
The addresses also switch a DAT/ACK [multiplexer](https://github.com/ddk/ddk-fpga/blob/master/hdl/ddk_core.v#L351) that ensures that there is no bus contention among these bus lines.
Currently there is no facility to read data from the FPGA, but this is the architecture that will be used in future designs.

## Integrating Custom Modules

Since the FPGA provides a Wishbone interface internally, modules conforming to the Wishbone interconnect can be integrated very easily.
The [krake_port][krake_port] module is a simple example of a such a module.
The [krake_port][krake_port] utilizes all 6 available GPIO pins available per channel.
This module implements bit banging, as well as the capability to output clocks generated on the DDK.

The DDK architecture utilizes the following signals per channel:

	input wire        clk_i,  // Wishbone clock
	input wire        rst_i,  // Wishbone reset
	output reg        ack_o,  // Wishbone module ack
	input wire [7:0]  dat_i,  // Wishbone data input
	input wire [3:0]  adr_i,  // Wishbone address input
	output reg [7:0]  dat_o,  // Wishbone data output
	input wire        stb_i,  // Wishbone strobe
	input wire        we_i,   // Wishbone write enable
	input wire [5:0]  ch_in,  // Channel I/O input
	output reg [5:0]  ch_out, // Channel I/O output
	output reg [5:0]  ch_oe,  // Channel I/O output enable

By replacing instances of the krake_port module in the [core](https://github.com/ddk/ddk-fpga/blob/master/hdl/ddk_core.v#L152) no further modifications to the core are necessary.
It is best practice to explicitly set channel I/O pins to disabled, i.e. ```ch_oe[0] <= 1'b0;```.
For modules that don't directly replace an instance of a channel module, the [strobes](https://github.com/ddk/ddk-fpga/blob/master/hdl/ddk_core.v#L336) and [multiplexers](https://github.com/ddk/ddk-fpga/blob/master/hdl/ddk_core.v#L350) must be configured accordingly to accomidate the new module.
The channel I/O signals may also need to be omitted if the module does not interface to the outside world, see [clk_gen](https://github.com/ddk/ddk-fpga/blob/master/hdl/clk_gen.v).

## Libero SoC Toolchain

For development for the Microsemi FPGAs the [Libero SoC Suite][libero] and a [free Libero Gold License][licensing] is required.
To obtain a lincese you must register with Microsemi.
The following outlines the steps necessary for installing the toolchain.

### Requesting a license

1.	Register for an account on the [Microsemi Support Portal][portal].
1.	Request a product license in the [Microsemi Support Portal][portal].
	Login and click "Request free license".
1.	Select the "Libero Gold Node Locked for Windows" license option.
	Note, we recommend using the Windows version of the toolchain.
1.	Enter a "DiskID" into the form.
	The easiest way to get a volume ID is to execute  
    `Vol C:` in Command Prompt.
1.	At this point you should have successfully requested a license. The license requests usually take less than an hour.

### Installing the software.

1.	Next, download the latest version of Libero SoC [here][downloads].
	Again, we recommend using the Windows version of the toolchain.
	We recommend installing the (large) "Self-Contained EXE" versus the "Web Install EXE".
1.	During installation you may be prompted to install install either "Libero SoC" or "Libero SoC SA (Standalone)".
	Select the "Libero SoC" version.
1.	When prompted, make sure you select and install atleast the ProASIC 3 Nano FPGA libraries.
	Note: you can also do this after the installation by starting "Uninstall or Modify Libero SoC" from the start menu and modifying the installation.
1.	After installation and once you have recieved your license, you can install it using the Actel License utility.
	This utility sets an enviornment variable that points to the License file, hence you may need to log out or restart the machine.
1.	To verify that the license is working, try starting "Synopsys Synplify".
	If you do not see license errors, than the license has been installed correctly.

### Linux installation.

We do not support the linux toolchain, however, people have reported this to be working.
If you wish to use the Microsemi toolchain under Linux, you can try Matt Gardner's linux instructions [here](https://github.com/ddk/ddk-fpga/README.linux.md).
